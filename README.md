## üîß Scripts

### Get-IntuneDeviceObjectIDs.ps1
Retrieves the Object IDs of Intune devices listed in a `.txt` file and generates a CSV file formatted for Intune bulk import operations. Includes interactive processing status and output logging.

### Check-ADComputerPresence.ps1
Scans a list of hostnames to confirm their presence in Active Directory and logs the `LastLogonDate` of each. Useful for identifying stale records and cleanup operations.

### Add-SCCMDevicesToCollection.ps1
Adds a list of hostnames to a specified ConfigMgr device collection. Uses the ConfigMgr module and supports progress feedback and logging of skipped or missing devices.

### Copy-FileToServers.ps1
Uses PowerShell background jobs to copy a file to a list of remote servers in parallel. Designed for fast distribution of tools, patches, or utilities across an enterprise environment.

### Send-ServerAndWebsiteStatusReport.ps1
Pings a list of internal servers and tests reachability of internal web apps. Generates a simple report (up/down counts, unreachable URLs) and sends it via SMTP email.
